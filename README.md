Prediction of Brain Stroke using Machine Learning Techniques
This repository contains the code and documentation for the research paper titled "Prediction of Brain Stroke using Machine Learning Techniques" by Sai deepak Pemmasani, Kalyana Lakshmi, Diveesh Poli.
Abstract
Stroke is a life-threatening condition that requires early detection and prevention measures. This research aims to develop and evaluate various machine learning models for predicting stroke occurrence based on patient data. The study utilizes the McKinsey & Company healthcare hackathon dataset, which includes 43,400 patient records with 12 attributes.
Dataset
The dataset used in this research is the McKinsey & Company healthcare hackathon dataset, which is publicly available for download. It contains 43,400 patient records, with 10 input features and 1 output feature (stroke occurrence).
Methodology
The research workflow involves the following steps:

Data Acquisition
Data Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model Training (CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, Bagging, and ExtraTrees Classifiers)
Model Evaluation (using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC)
Model Comparison and Selection

Results
The research found that the ExtraTrees Classifier outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 99.8%. The performance metrics of all evaluated models are provided in the paper.
Future Work
The authors suggest further research to enhance the predictive capabilities of stroke prediction models, potentially incorporating additional features or exploring ensemble techniques. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately forecast stroke risk and facilitate early intervention and personalized preventive measures.
References
The paper cites various related works and provides a comprehensive list of references.
